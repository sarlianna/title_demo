NES Title Demo
==========
Status: Unfinished

A demo title screen for NES showing 0 sprite hit detection for raster effects.
This project attempts to re-create the effect that Zelda II: The Adventure of Link uses on its title screen.
The screen features scrolling text on the top half, with a static graphic display on the bottom.
Games like Zelda II and Super Mario Brothers use the 0 sprite to accomplish the scrolling screen with static elements.

While mostly meant as a project for myself, it is heavily commented, so feel free to use it as a resource
(I don't guarantee good code or practices).  I purposefully added comments explaining registers being used.
