NES Title Demo
==========
Status: Unfinished

A demo title screen for NES showing 0 sprite hit detection for raster effects.
This project attempts to re-create the effect that Zelda II: The Adventure of Link uses on its title screen.
The screen features scrolling text on the top half, with a static graphic display on the bottom.
Games like Zelda II and Super Mario Brothers use the 0 sprite to accomplish the scrolling screen with static elements.

It is heavily commented and meant to be used as an example of using the 0 sprite for similar effects, aimed at 
those who may not fully understand it.  It's also to help me understand it properly.
I don't guarantee that it will be helpful. 

Keep in mind that sprite 0 detection is not the only way to accomplish these effects.
